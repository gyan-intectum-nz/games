- Deferred rendering
- Parallel rendering
- Occlusion culling
- Add the 'container' concept? Each container would maintain the count of data elements in each partition of each partitioned array (replaces the 'context' concept).
- Vertex types? Only trouble could be things like render and import which need to know the vertex info
- Remove all global state from ludo
- Switch to bazel
- Remove dynamic containers from data types stored in the instance
- Create celestial body static bodies on predicted path! Currently it can create them too late and sometimes when you are part way through the surface...
- Fix slight head movement in spaceship when rolling
- Refine atmosphere, looks better at altitude
- Shadow mapping
- Phong and PBR lights
- CEF/UI
- Trees, rocks and grass
- Specify layout info in shader to prevent need for specifying vertex attributes? Is that a thing?
- Simplify buffers, get ref to position, add streams
