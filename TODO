Bugs
- Create celestial body static bodies on predicted path! Currently it can create them too late and sometimes when you are part way through the surface...
- Fix slight head movement in spaceship when rolling
- Refine atmosphere, looks better at altitude and is slow

Structural
- Switch to bazel
- Remove dynamic containers from data types stored in the instance
- Remove unneeded IDs from data types
- Add the 'container' concept? Each container would maintain the count of data elements in each partition of each partitioned array (replaces the 'context' concept).
- Vulkan
- In-house physics
- In-house noise
- Job scheduler a la Unity DOTS
- Split buffer and allocators instead of having separate heap type etc.
