- Black square flashing on screen. Usually on sun. Something to do with bloom effect?
- Build render commands on GPU (single index/vertex/data buffer)?
- Deferred rendering
- Parallel rendering
- Occlusion culling
- Add the 'container' concept? Each container would maintain the count of data elements in each partition of each partitioned array (replaces the 'context' concept).
- Vertex types? Only trouble could be things like render and import which need to know the vertex info (esp. render which needs to render diff vertex types separately - render program contains vertex info?).
- split import.cpp into multiple files
- split mesh into mesh and mesh_instance
- remove all global state from ludo
- switch to bazel
- remove dynamic containers from data types stored in the instance
